/* FROM RFC 4648

The Base 64 encoding is designed to represent arbitrary sequences of
octets in a form that allows the use of both upper- and lowercase
letters but that need not be human readable.

A 65-character subset of US-ASCII is used, enabling 6 bits to be
represented per printable character.  (The extra 65th character, "=",
is used to signify a special processing function.)

The encoding process represents 24-bit groups of input bits as output
strings of 4 encoded characters.  Proceeding from left to right, a
24-bit input group is formed by concatenating 3 8-bit input groups.
These 24 bits are then treated as 4 concatenated 6-bit groups, each
of which is translated into a single character in the base 64
alphabet.

Each 6-bit group is used as an index into an array of 64 printable
characters.  The character referenced by the index is placed in the
output string.

Special processing is performed if fewer than 24 bits are available
at the end of the data being encoded.  A full encoding quantum is
always completed at the end of a quantity.  When fewer than 24 input
bits are available in an input group, bits with value zero are added
(on the right) to form an integral number of 6-bit groups.  Padding
at the end of the data is performed using the '=' character.  Since
all base 64 input is an integral number of octets, only the following
cases can arise:

(1) The final quantum of encoding input is an integral multiple of 24
    bits; here, the final unit of encoded output will be an integral
    multiple of 4 characters with no "=" padding.

(2) The final quantum of encoding input is exactly 8 bits; here, the
    final unit of encoded output will be two characters followed by
    two "=" padding characters.

(3) The final quantum of encoding input is exactly 16 bits; here, the
    final unit of encoded output will be three characters followed by
    one "=" padding character.
